```bash
sudo bash
wget https://github.com/ftnt-cse/soc_simulator/archive/master.zip -O soc_simulator.zip && unzip soc_simulator.zip && rm -f soc_simulator.zip
cd soc_simulator-master
chmod +x soc_simulator.py
sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
To configure soc_simulator use the below instructions (Only required if your FortiSOAR has none-default credentials):

-  vi config.json and update FortiSOAR IP and credentials with the ones from your environment

# Environment requirements

-  Download MITRE Att&ck Techniques
	- Browse to : Automation > Playbooks > 13 - MITRE ATT&CK™-Pull-Technique-Details > Download Mitre Techniques
	- Click on the trigger button ► ( it may take time)
    - Alternatively import the **Playbook_collection_Mitre_Local_Import.json** collection from the scenario folder and run **A: Download Mitre Techniques** playbook manually, it may take some time due to network and device performance.
- Deactivate the default enrichment playbook (or set a "Generic" tag as a triggering condition)

# Run the demo
    - Modify the default config (config.json) if required (if soc_simulator is installed on FortiSOAR and you haven't changed the default username/password you don't need to change anything):
    - Run the demo:
```bash
./soc_simulator.py -f scenarios/FortiSOAR/Advanced_Phishing_Email/ 
```

# Demo script:
## Alert 1: False positive
- (If an Exchange server is present): Open asmith@fortielab.com inbox and show both the suspected email and the acknowledgment email from SOAR stating the email has been received for investigation
- A user suspects a legitimate email to be malicious
- Incident Response > Alerts > Suspicious Email:Immediate action required (Minimal)
- FortiSOAR doesn't find any indicators
- The Alert is closed as a false positive since it's an internal email
- Check Closure Note

## Alert 2: True Phishing Email
- Incident Response > Alerts > Suspicious Email:Immediate action required (Critical)
- Alert Description: Alert Summary
- Alert Description: MITRE ATT&CK technique descriptions, more details => Correlations tab > ATTACK Technique > right click > Open in new tab
